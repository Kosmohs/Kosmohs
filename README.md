<!-- ### Hey, I'm Kos, a beginning back-end developer from Kz.
My last job as an audit-company staff made me think of studying coding, and now I'm in here trying to eventually become some good developer to be able to make a change .. maybe, we'll see.
You can browse around my repositories all you like, have fun.
Have a good coding!

And now, ... wake up -->
